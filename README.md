Analysis on the Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024
## Exploratory Data Analysis on Most Streamed Songs on Spotify

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2024. The objective is to analyse the key attributes and trends that contribute to a song’s popularity. By leveraging data exploration and visualization techniques, we uncover insights related to artist performance, song duration, release dates, and more. Through this analysis, we aim to understand the patterns in streaming behaviour and how musical attributes affect popularity.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of detailed information about the most streamed songs on Spotify. The key features include:
•	Track Name: The title of the song.
•	Artist(s): The artist(s) who performed the song.
•	Release Date: The date the song was released.
•	Streams: The number of streams the song has received.
•	Duration: Length of the song in seconds.
•	Genre: The genre of the song (if available).
•	Musical Attributes: Characteristics such as tempo, danceability, energy, and more.
You can find the dataset in the repository as Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024.csv.

 ## Data Exploration
In this section, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset. Key steps include:
•	Basic Statistics: Summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical features.
•	Distribution Analysis: Histograms and density plots to explore the distribution of features like streams, song duration, and tempo.
•	Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps to identify potential relationships between different features, such as streams and song attributes.

## Data Preprocessing
•	Loading the Dataset: The dataset is imported using pandas, and basic checks for missing values, data types, and descriptive statistics are performed.
•	Data Cleaning: This involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types (e.g., transforming Release Date into datetime format).
•	Feature Engineering: Additional features, such as song length in minutes or categorizing songs by release year, are created for enhanced analysis.

## Key Features
The analysis delves into various features, including:
•	Number of Artists: Analysing collaborations and their impact on song popularity.
•	Chart Rankings: Examining the presence and rank of songs on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.
•	Musical Attributes: In-depth exploration of key musical elements such as tempo, danceability, and energy.

## Data Visualizations
Visualizations play a critical role in interpreting the dataset and uncovering trends. The following visualizations are included:
•	Histograms: For numerical attributes like tempo, energy, and danceability.
•	Scatter Plots: To explore relationships between features such as streams and song duration.
•	Heatmaps: To visualize correlations between song attributes.
•	Bar Charts: Displaying the top artists and most streamed songs.

## Key Visualizations
•	Top 10 Most Streamed Songs: A bar chart highlighting the songs with the highest number of streams.
•	Streams by Artist: A breakdown of streams across various artists.
•	Release Year Trends: A line chart showing the evolution of song releases over the years.
•	Song Duration Distribution: A histogram illustrating the spread of song durations.

## Key Insights
The analysis reveals several interesting trends, including:
•	Most Popular Artists: Insights into which artists dominate the streaming charts.
•	Trends in Release Years: How the release years of the most popular songs vary.
•	Song Duration Insights: The typical duration of the most streamed songs.
•	Genre Trends: Analysis of genre popularity (if available in the dataset).

This project sheds light on the key factors that drive song popularity on Spotify. By examining streaming statistics and musical attributes, we gain a better understanding of what makes a song resonate with audiences. Future directions could include expanding the analysis to include sentiment analysis of song lyrics or predictive modelling.
